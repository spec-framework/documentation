Spec Documentation [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/SpecForPharo/documentation.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/SpecForPharo/documentation)
==================

All the documentation for Spec will be stored here
where a pier file stands for a chapter.

The current stable output can be read [here](https://github.com/SpecForPharo/documentation/blob/master/output/book.md).


## Guidelines

Few tips to ease the collaboration using git.

1. One sentence per line: it helps the diff tools to provide more accurate output
2. While working on a chapter, do not hesitate branching: it provides a more accurate view of what is under construction.
3. Create a Pull Request for each branch: it will not be accepted until the original author says it's ready, but it will provide a support for review and feedback
